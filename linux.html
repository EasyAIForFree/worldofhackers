                <p>GNU is a project that provides free software components like compilers and utilities, while Linux is a kernel that manages hardware and system resources. Together, GNU software and the Linux kernel form a complete operating system, often referred to as "Linux." The term "GNU/Linux" more accurately describes this combination.</p>
